Baba hates blind web challenges! He loves reading code, and wants other people to read code as well. So, he crafted this website to share his love!

There are some bugs that Baba is still working on fixing, but he trusts that his coding abilities are decent enough to not have accidentally created a major vulnerability in his website.
Can you prove how bad of a programmer Baba is?
