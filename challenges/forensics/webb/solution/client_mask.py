The '''James Webb Space Telescope''' ('''JWST''') is a [[space telescope]] designed to conduct [[infrared astronomy]]. As the largest [[Space telescope|telescope in space]], it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, [[List of the most distant astronomical objects|distant]], or faint for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref name="SA-20221201">{{cite news |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |date=1 December 2022 |title=How JWST Is Changing Our View of the Universe – The James Webb Space Telescope has sparked a new era in astronomy |work=[[Scientific American]] |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-jwst-is-changing-our-view-of-the-universe/ |url-status=live |accessdate=15 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221115141753/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-jwst-is-changing-our-view-of-the-universe/ |archive-date=15 November 2022}}</ref> This enables investigations across many fields of [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], such as observation of the [[Population III star|first stars]] and the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of the first galaxies]], and detailed atmospheric characterization of [[potentially habitable exoplanet]]s.<ref name="NYT-20220823" /><ref name="WP-20220805" /><ref name="SA-20230123">{{cite news |last=O'Callaghan |first=Jonathan |date=23 January 2023 |title=JWST Heralds a New Dawn for Exoplanet Science – The James Webb Space Telescope is opening an exciting new chapter in the study of exoplanets and the search for life beyond Earth |work=[[Scientific American]] |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jwst-heralds-a-new-dawn-for-exoplanet-science/ |accessdate=25 January 2023}}</ref>

The Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from [[Kourou]], French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth [[L2 point|L<sub>2</sub>]] [[Lagrange point]], about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=out|sp=us}} from Earth. [[Webb's First Deep Field|The telescope's first image]] was released to the public on 11 July 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Alise |last2=Pinol |first2=Natasha |last3=Betz |first3=Laura |date=11 July 2022 |title=President Biden Reveals First Image from NASA's Webb Telescope |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/president-biden-reveals-first-image-from-nasa-s-webb-telescope |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=NASA |archive-date=12 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220712074730/https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/president-biden-reveals-first-image-from-nasa-s-webb-telescope/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The U.S. [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). The NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Maryland]] managed telescope development, while the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] in [[Baltimore]] on the [[Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University]] operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was [[Northrop Grumman]].

The [[#Naming concerns|telescope is named]] after [[James E. Webb]], who was the [[List of administrators and deputy administrators of NASA|administrator of NASA]] from 1961 to 1968 during the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs.

Webb's [[primary mirror]] consists of 18 hexagonal [[Segmented mirror|mirror segments]] made of [[gold]]-plated [[beryllium]], which together create a {{convert|6.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter|abbr=out|sp=us}} mirror, compared with Hubble's {{cvt|2.4|m|ftin|adj=on}}. This gives Webb a [[Aperture|light-collecting area]] of about {{Convert|25|m2|abbr=on}}, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the [[Ultraviolet|near ultraviolet]] and [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.1 to 0.8&nbsp;[[μm]]), and [[near infrared]] (0.8–2.5&nbsp;μm)<ref name=CWHT/> spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible [[light]] (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.3&nbsp;μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below {{cvt|50|K|0}}, so that the [[infrared]] light [[Black-body radiation|emitted]] by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layer [[Sunshield (JWST)|sunshield]] protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

Initial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, [[#Background (development to 2003)|began in 1996]]. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays. A major redesign was accomplished in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion.

== Features ==
The mass of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is about half that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Webb has a {{convert|6.5|m|adj=on|abbr=unit|sp=us}}-diameter [[gold]]-coated [[beryllium]] [[primary mirror]] made up of 18 separate hexagonal mirrors. The mirror has a polished area of {{cvt|26.3|m2|ft2}}, of which {{cvt|0.9|m2|ft2}} is obscured by the secondary support struts,<ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1203.0002|doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.1.011011 |title=Experience with the Hubble Space Telescope: 20 years of an archetype|year=2012|last1=Lallo|first1=Matthew D.|s2cid=15722152|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=51|issue=1|pages=011011–011011–19 |bibcode=2012OptEn..51a1011L}}</ref> giving a total collecting area of {{cvt|25.4|m2|ft2}}. This is over six times larger than the collecting area of Hubble's {{convert|2.4|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=unit|sp=us}} diameter mirror, which has a collecting area of {{cvt|4.0|m2|ft2}}. The mirror has a gold coating to provide infrared [[reflectivity]] and this is covered by a thin layer of glass for durability.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mirrors Webb/NASA |url=https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=webb.nasa.gov |language=en |archive-date=4 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204204441/https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for several reasons:
* high-redshift (very early and distant) objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, and therefore their light can be observed only via infrared [[astronomy]];{{r|CWHT}}
* infrared light passes more easily through [[cosmic dust#Some "dusty" clouds in the universe|dust clouds]] than visible light;<ref name=CWHT>{{cite web |title=Comparison: Webb vs Hubble Telescope – Webb/NASA |url=https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/comparisonWebbVsHubble.html |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=www.jwst.nasa.gov |language=en |archive-date=21 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121063242/https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/comparisonWebbVsHubble.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
* colder objects such as [[debris disk]]s and planets emit most strongly in the infrared;
* these infrared bands are difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.

[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.4|Rough plot of Earth's [[Atmosphere of Earth#Absorption|atmospheric absorption]] (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [[visible light]]]]
Ground-based telescopes must look through [[Earth's atmosphere]], which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure at right). Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane, also exist in the Earth's atmosphere, vastly complicating analysis. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are insufficiently cool (the Hubble mirror is maintained at about {{cvt|15|C|K F|0|disp=sqbr}}) which means that the telescope itself radiates strongly in the relevant infrared bands.<ref name="ipac.caltech.edu"/>

Webb can also observe objects in the [[Solar System]] at an angle of more than 85° from the Sun and having an apparent [[angular velocity|angular rate of motion]] less than 0.03 arc seconds per second.{{efn|name= tracking |JWST was designed with the requirement to track objects that move as fast as Mars, which has a maximum apparent speed on the sky of 30 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|mas]]/s, which is the value given in the technical specification, i.e. the nominal value.<ref name="Fisher 2022-07-14">{{cite web |last=Fisher |first=Alise |date=14 July 2022 |title=Webb Images of Jupiter and More Now Available in Commissioning Data |url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/07/14/webb-images-of-jupiter-and-more-now-available-in-commission |website=James Webb Space Telescope (NASA Blogs) |access-date=8 August 2022 |archive-date=16 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230116231556/https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/07/14/webb-images-of-jupiter-and-more-now-available-in-commissioning-data/ |url-status=live }}</ref><br />During commissioning, various asteroids were observed to determine the actual limitation for the speed of objects and it turned out to be 67 mas/s, which is more than twice the nominal value. Tracking at rates of 30–67 mas/s showed accuracies similar to tracking of slower targets. Thus, the telescope is able to observe also [[near-Earth asteroids]] (NEAs), comets closer to perihelion and [[interstellar object]]s.{{r|Rigby 2022-07-12|p=8}}<br />Later, after more experience with [[Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph|FGS]] had been gained, the tracking speed limit was finally set to 75 mas/s for routine observations.

=== Location and orbit ===
Webb operates in a [[halo orbit]], circling around a point in space known as the Sun–Earth L<sub>2</sub> [[Lagrange point]], approximately {{cvt|1500000|km}} beyond Earth's orbit around the Sun.

Webb's [[primary mirror]] is a {{cvt|6.5|m}}-diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of {{cvt|25.4|m2}}. If it had been designed as a single, large mirror, it would have been too large for existing launch vehicles. The mirror is therefore composed of 18 hexagonal segments (a technique pioneered by [[Guido Horn d'Arturo]]), which unfolded after the telescope was launched. Image plane [[Wave-front sensing|wavefront sensing]] through [[Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm|phase retrieval]] is used to position the [[mirror segment]]s in the correct location using precise [[actuator]]s. Subsequent to this initial configuration, they only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/ote/wavefront-sensing-and-control|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805213402/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/ote/wavefront-sensing-and-control|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2012|title=JWST Wavefront Sensing and Control|publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute|access-date=9 June 2011}}</ref> This is unlike terrestrial telescopes, for example the [[W.

The [[Integrated Science Instrument Module]] (ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, computing resources, cooling capability as well as structural stability to the Webb telescope. It is made with bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb's telescope structure. The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera.<ref name=isim/>
* [[NIRCam]] (Near Infrared Camera) is an [[Thermographic camera|infrared imager]] which has spectral coverage ranging from the edge of the visible (0.6&nbsp;μm) through to the near infrared (5&nbsp;μm).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instruments/nircam/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130403110410/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instruments/nircam/|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 April 2013|title=James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera|publisher=STScI|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/nircam/|title=NIRCam for the James Webb Space Telescope|publisher=University of Arizona|access-date=24 October 2013|archive-date=3 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211103203919/http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/nircam/|url-status=live}}</ref> There are 10 sensors each of 4 megapixels. NIRCam serves as the observatory's wavefront sensor, which is required for wavefront sensing and control activities, used to align and focus the main mirror segments. NIRCam was built by a team led by the [[University of Arizona]], with principal investigator [[Marcia J. Rieke]].<ref name="WhoDoesWhatWeb">{{cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/status.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090715053935/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/overview/status.html |url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2009 |title=JWST Current Status|publisher=STScI|access-date=5 July 2008}}</ref>
* [[NIRSpec]] (Near Infrared Spectrograph) performs [[spectroscopy]] over the same wavelength range. It was built by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) at [[ESTEC]] in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands. The leading development team includes members from [[Airbus Defence and Space]], Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]; with Pierre Ferruit ([[École normale supérieure de Lyon]]) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 [[Multi-Object Spectrometer|multi-object]] mode, and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly mechanism. Both mechanisms are based on the successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the [[Infrared Space Observatory]]. The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec's field of view. There are two sensors, each of 4 megapixels.<ref name="nirspec">{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/jwst/45694-nirspec-the-near-infrared-spectrograph/|title=NIRSpec – the near-infrared spectrograph on JWST|publisher=European Space Agency|date=22 February 2015|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-date=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403162415/http://sci.esa.int/jwst/45694-nirspec-the-near-infrared-spectrograph/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Software ===
Ilana Dashevsky and Vicki Balzano write that Webb uses a modified version of [[JavaScript]], called Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e, for its operations; it follows the [[ECMAScript|ECMAScript standard]] and "allows for a modular design flow, where on-board scripts call lower-level scripts that are defined as functions". "The JWST science operations will be driven by ASCII (instead of binary command blocks) on-board scripts, written in a customized version of JavaScript. The script interpreter is run by the flight software, which is written in the programming language [[C++]].

The desire for a large infrared space telescope traces back decades. In the United States, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (later called the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]) was planned while the Space Shuttle was in development, and the potential for infrared astronomy was acknowledged at that time.<ref name="proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org">{{cite conference |last1=McCarthy |first1=S. G. |last2=Autio |first2=G. W. |year=1978 |title=Infrared Detector Performance In The Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) |url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1227080 |conference=1978 Los Angeles Technical Symposium |series=Utilization of Infrared Detectors |publisher=Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers |volume=81 |issue=6 June |pages=81–88 |bibcode=1978SPIE..132...81M |doi=10.1117/12.956060 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305015734/http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1227080 |archive-date=5 March 2017 |access-date=8 December 2016 |url-status=live |quote=The tenuous atmosphere above the 400 km nominal flight altitude has no measurable absorption so that detectors operating at all wavelengths from 5 μm to 1000 μm can achieve high radiometric sensitivity.}}</ref> Unlike ground telescopes, space observatories are free from atmospheric absorption of infrared light. Space observatories opened a "new sky" for astronomers.

However, there is a challenge involved in the design of infrared telescopes: they need to stay extremely cold, and the longer the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful design. One method is to put the key instruments in a [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewar]] with an extremely cold substance, such as [[liquid helium]]. The coolant will slowly vaporize, limiting the lifetime of the instrument from as short as a few months to a few years at most.<ref name="ipac.caltech.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html|title=Infrared astronomy from earth orbit|publisher=Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, NASA Spitzer Science Center, California Institute of Technology|date=2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221020839/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html|archive-date=21 December 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

It is also possible to maintain a low temperature by designing the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, as with the extended missions of the Spitzer Space Telescope and the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], which operated at reduced capacity after coolant depletion. Another example is Hubble's [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) instrument, which started out using a block of [[Solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]] that depleted after a couple of years, but was then replaced during the [[STS-109]] servicing mission with a [[cryocooler]] that worked continuously. The Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshields and radiators, with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-06-cold-cooler-nasa-telescope.html|title=How cold can you go?

Webb's delays and cost increases have been compared to those of its predecessor, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. When Hubble formally started in 1972, it had an estimated development cost of US$300 million ({{Inflation|US|300000000|1972|fmt=eq|r=-3}}), but by the time it was sent into orbit in 1990, the cost was about four times that. In addition, new instruments and servicing missions increased the cost to at least US$9 billion by 2006<ref name="nature06"/> ({{Inflation|US|9000000000|2006|fmt=eq|r=-3}}).

Correcting the [[Hubble Space Telescope#Flawed mirror|flawed optics]] of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its first years played a significant role in the birth of Webb.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/optics/hubbles-mirror-flaw/|title= Hubble's Mirror Flaw|author= |date= |publisher= NASA|accessdate=June 19, 2024}}</ref> In 1993, NASA conducted [[STS-61]], [[Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 1|the Space Shuttle mission]] that replaced HST's camera and installed a retrofit for its imaging spectrograph to compensate for the [[spherical aberration]] in its [[primary mirror]].

An [[administrator of NASA]], [[Daniel Goldin|Dan Goldin]], coined the phrase "[[faster, better, cheaper]]", and opted for the next big paradigm shift for astronomy, namely, breaking the barrier of a single mirror. That meant going from "eliminate moving parts" to "learn to live with moving parts" (i.e. segmented optics). With the goal to reduce mass density tenfold, [[silicon carbide]] with a very thin layer of glass on top was first looked at, but [[beryllium]] was selected at the end.<ref name="Space_is_changing"/>

=== Early development and replanning (2003–2007) ===
[[File:JWST people.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Early full-scale model on display at NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (2005)]]Development was managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with [[John C. Mather]] as its project scientist. The primary contractor was Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, responsible for developing and building the spacecraft element, which included the [[satellite bus]], sunshield, Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) which connects the [[Optical Telescope Element]] to the spacecraft bus, and the Mid Boom Assembly (MBA) which helps to deploy the large sunshields on orbit,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Northrop_Grumman_Completes_Fabrication_Of_Sunshield_Deployment_Flight_Structure_For_JWST_999.html| title=Northrop Grumman Completes Fabrication Of Sunshield Deployment Flight Structure For JWST| publisher=Space Daily| date=13 December 2011| access-date=10 December 2014| archive-date=18 January 2022| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118030148/https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Northrop_Grumman_Completes_Fabrication_Of_Sunshield_Deployment_Flight_Structure_For_JWST_999.html| url-status=live}}</ref> while [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies]] was subcontracted to develop and build the OTE itself, and the [[Integrated Science Instrument Module]] (ISIM).<ref name="isim">{{cite web|url=https://jwst.nasa.gov/isim.html|title=JWST: Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM)|publisher=NASA|date=2017|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-date=2 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602100607/https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/isim.html|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Cost growth revealed in spring 2005 led to an August 2005 re-planning.<ref name="replan"/> The primary technical outcomes of the re-planning were significant changes in the integration and test plans, a 22-month launch delay (from 2011 to 2013), and elimination of system-level testing for observatory modes at wavelengths shorter than 1.7&nbsp;μm. Other major features of the observatory were unchanged. Following the re-planning, the project was independently reviewed in April 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In the 2005 re-plan, the life-cycle cost of the project was estimated at US$4.5 billion. This comprised approximately US$3.5 billion for design, development, launch and commissioning, and approximately US$1.0 billion for ten years of operations.<ref name="replan">{{cite web |author=Mather |first=John |title=James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/CAA_Nov2005_Presentation_Mather.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110180605/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/CAA_Nov2005_Presentation_Mather.pdf |archive-date=10 November 2008 |access-date=5 July 2008 |publisher=National Academy of Science}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The ESA agreed in 2004 to contributing about €300 million, including the launch.<ref name="ESA Media Relations Service">{{cite press release|url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/Pr_10_2004_s_en.html|title=European agreement on James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) signed|date=9 June 2004|publisher=ESA Media Relations Service|access-date=6 May 2009|archive-date=18 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518064607/http://www.esa.int/esaSC/Pr_10_2004_s_en.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The CSA pledged CA$39 million in 2007<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canadian Space Agency|date=4 June 2007|title=Canada's contribution to NASA's James Webb Space Telescope|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2007/06/canada-contribution-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope.html|access-date=3 July 2021|website=canada.ca|archive-date=18 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118031434/https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2007/06/canada-contribution-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2012 delivered its contributions in equipment to point the telescope and detect atmospheric conditions on distant planets.<ref>{{cite web|date=30 July 2012|title=Canadian Space Agency Delivers Canada's Contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope|url=https://spaceq.ca/canadian_space_agency_delivers_canadas_contributions_to_the_james_webb_space_telescope/|access-date=3 July 2021|website=SpaceQ|archive-date=18 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118031451/https://spaceq.ca/canadian_space_agency_delivers_canadas_contributions_to_the_james_webb_space_telescope/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2007, nine of the ten technology development items in the project successfully passed a Non-Advocate Review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/news/2007/jwst-passes-tnar|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805232222/http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/news/2007/jwst-passes-tnar|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2012|title=JWST Passes TNAR|publisher=STScI|access-date=5 July 2008}}</ref> These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to retire significant risks in the project. The remaining technology development item (the [[MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument)|MIRI]] cryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning step in the process that ultimately moved the project into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/070523_techwed_jwst_dock.html|title=NASA Adds Docking Capability For Next Space Observatory|first=Brian|last=Berger|date=23 May 2007|website=SPACE.com|access-date=5 July 2008|archive-date=30 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630180805/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/070523_techwed_jwst_dock.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2008, the project successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR).

In April 2010, the telescope passed the technical portion of its Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR). Passing the MCDR signified the integrated observatory can meet all science and engineering requirements for its mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/apr/HQ_10-099_Webb_Telescope_Milestone.html|title=NASA's Webb Telescope Passes Key Mission Design Review Milestone|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-date=1 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501144204/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/apr/HQ_10-099_Webb_Telescope_Milestone.html|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The MCDR encompassed all previous design reviews. The project schedule underwent review during the months following the MCDR, in a process called the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which led to a re-plan of the mission aiming for a 2015 launch, but as late as 2018. By 2010, cost over-runs were impacting other projects, though Webb itself remained on schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1008/12jwst/|title=NASA says JWST cost crunch impeding new missions|first=Stephen|last=Clark|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=12 August 2010|access-date=13 August 2010|archive-date=29 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429114441/https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1008/12jwst/|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 2011, the Webb project was in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C).

A study in 1984 by the Space Science Board estimated that to build a next-generation infrared observatory in orbit would cost US$4 billion (US$7B in 2006 dollars, or $10B in 2020 dollars).<ref name="nature06" /> While this came close to the final cost of Webb, the first NASA design considered in the late 1990s was more modest, aiming for a $1&nbsp;billion price tag over 10 years of construction. Over time this design expanded, added funding for contingencies, and had scheduling delays.

By 2008, when the project entered preliminary design review and was formally confirmed for construction, over US$1 billion had already been spent on developing the telescope, and the total budget was estimated at US$5 billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5|2005|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{inflation/fn|US}} In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review (CDR) with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland U.S. Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] to call for external review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of US$1.5 billion (for a total of US$6.5 billion). ISC2CTF{webb_webb_webb_webb_webb_weeb_webb_webb_webb_websockets!} They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.<ref name="499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf|title=Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, Final Report|date=29 October 2010|access-date=10 June 2011|archive-date=17 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117185346/https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

On 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed US$1.9 billion from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for Webb.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope|title=Nasa fights to save the James Webb space telescope from the axe|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=Robin|last=McKie|date=9 July 2011|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317210545/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://appropriations.house.gov/news/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023|title=Appropriations Committee Releases the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations|publisher=US House of representatives Committee on Appropriations|date=6 July 2011|access-date=7 July 2011|archive-date=23 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323111945/http://appropriations.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html|title=US lawmakers vote to kill Hubble successor|publisher=SpaceDaily|date=7 July 2011|access-date=8 July 2011|archive-date=10 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710020814/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html|title=Proposed NASA Budget Bill Would Cancel Major Space Telescope|publisher=Space.com|date=6 July 2011|access-date=11 July 2011|archive-date=9 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709024728/http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html|url-status=live}}</ref> US$3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=James Webb Space Telescope hardware entering key test phase|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com|date=7 January 2015|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107152854/https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/|url-status=live}}</ref> This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day.

=== Partnership ===
NASA, ESA and CSA have collaborated on the telescope since 1996. ESA's participation in construction and launch was approved by its members in 2003 and an agreement was signed between ESA and NASA in 2007. In exchange for full partnership, representation and access to the observatory for its astronomers, ESA is providing the NIRSpec instrument, the Optical Bench Assembly of the MIRI instrument, an [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5 ECA]] launcher, and manpower to support operations.<ref name="ESA Media Relations Service"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sci.esa.int/web/jwst/-/45728-europe-s-role|title=ESA Science & Technology – Europe's Contributions to the JWST Mission|website=European Space Agency|access-date=19 December 2021|archive-date=19 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319004958/https://sci.esa.int/web/jwst/-/45728-europe-s-role|url-status=live}}</ref> The CSA provided the Fine Guidance Sensor and the Near-Infrared Imager Slitless Spectrograph and manpower to support operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2012/0730.asp |title=Canadian Space Agency 'Eyes' Hubble's Successor: Canada Delivers its Contribution to the World's Most Powerful Space Telescope |publisher=Canadian Space Agency |date=12 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412124143/http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2012/0730.asp |archive-date=12 April 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Naming concerns ===
{{See also|James E. Webb#NASA|James E. Webb#Legacy}}
In 2002, NASA administrator (2001–2004) [[Sean O'Keefe]] made the decision to name the telescope after [[James E. Webb]], the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and much of the [[Apollo program]]s.<ref name="nameannounce" /><ref name=":4" />

In 2015, concerns were raised around Webb's possible role in the [[lavender scare]], the mid-20th-century persecution by the U.S. government targeting [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] in [[Federal government of the United States|federal employment]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Matthew |title=The Problem With Naming Observatories For Bigots |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewfrancis/2015/06/11/the-problem-with-naming-observatories-for-bigots/ |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=Forbes |language=en |archive-date=11 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220411042530/https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewfrancis/2015/06/11/the-problem-with-naming-observatories-for-bigots/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=January 21, 2015 |first=Dan |last=Savage |title=Should NASA Name a Telescope After a Dead Guy Who Persecuted Gay People in the 1950s? |url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2015/01/21/should-nasa-name-a-telescope-after-a-dead-guy-who-persecuted-gay-people-in-the-1950s |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=The Stranger |language=en |archive-date=24 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124072342/http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2015/01/21/should-nasa-name-a-telescope-after-a-dead-guy-who-persecuted-gay-people-in-the-1950s |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2022, NASA released a report of an investigation,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Alise |title=NASA Shares James Webb History Report |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-shares-james-webb-history-report |website=NASA |access-date=25 November 2022 |date=18 November 2022 |archive-date=24 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124083102/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-shares-james-webb-history-report/ |url-status=live }}</ref> based on an examination of more than 50,000 documents.

== Mission goals ==
The James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals:
* to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang
* to study [[galaxy formation and evolution]]
* to understand [[star formation]] and [[planet formation]]
* to study planetary systems and the [[Abiogenesis|origins of life]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Masetti |first1=Maggie |last2=Krishnamurthi |first2=Anita |date=2009 |title=JWST Science |url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/science.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124152624/https://jwst.nasa.gov/science.html |archive-date=24 November 2017 |access-date=14 April 2013 |publisher=NASA |language=en-us}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason, Webb's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to perform [[infrared astronomy]]. Webb will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 28&nbsp;μm (corresponding respectively to orange light and deep infrared radiation at about {{cvt|100|K|C|disp=or}}).

Webb may be used to gather information on the dimming light of star [[Tabby's Star|KIC 8462852]], which was discovered in 2015, and has some abnormal light-curve properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/telescopes/a19346/james-webb-telescope-alien-megastructure/|title=NASA's Next Telescope Could ID Alien Megastructures|date=9 February 2016|access-date=1 September 2016|archive-date=9 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009124137/https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/telescopes/a19346/james-webb-telescope-alien-megastructure/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Orbit design ===
[[File:L2 rendering.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Webb is not exactly at the {{L2|nolink=yes}} point, but circles around it in a [[halo orbit]].]]
[[File:Carina Nebula in Visible and Infrared.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Alternative [[Hubble Space Telescope]] views of the [[Carina Nebula]], comparing ultraviolet and visible (top) and infrared (bottom) astronomy. Far more stars are visible in the latter.]]

Webb orbits the Sun near the second [[Lagrange point]] ({{L2|nolink=yes}}) of the Sun–Earth system, which is {{cvt|1500000|km}} farther from the Sun than the Earth's orbit, and about four times farther than the Moon's orbit. Normally an object circling the Sun farther out than Earth would take longer than one year to complete its orbit. But near the {{L2}} point, the combined gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun allow a spacecraft to orbit the Sun in the same time that it takes the Earth. Staying close to Earth allows data rates to be much faster for a given size of antenna.

The telescope circles about the Sun–Earth {{L2|nolink=yes}} point in a [[halo orbit]], which is inclined with respect to the [[ecliptic]], has a radius varying between about {{cvt|250000|km}} and {{cvt|832000|km}}, and takes about half a year to complete.<ref name="stsci.edu"/> Since {{L2|nolink=yes}} is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull, a halo orbit is not an orbit in the usual sense: the spacecraft is actually in orbit around the Sun, and the halo orbit can be thought of as controlled drifting to remain in the vicinity of the {{L2|nolink=yes}} point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basics of Space Flight|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf5-1.php|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-date=11 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611064749/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf5-1.php|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This requires some [[Orbital station-keeping|station-keeping]]: around {{val|2.5|u=m/s}} per year<ref>{{cite web |author=Dichmann |first1=Donald J. |last2=Alberding |first2=Cassandra M. |last3=Yu |first3=Wayne H. |date=5 May 2014 |title=STATIONKEEPING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140007519/downloads/20140007519.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217000634/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140007519/downloads/20140007519.pdf |archive-date=17 December 2021 |access-date=29 December 2021 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> from the total [[Delta-v|∆''v'']] budget of {{val|93|u=m/s}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=Greenhouse |first=Matt |date=1 April 2016 |title=The James Webb Space Telescope Mission |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170004986/downloads/20170004986.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229192654/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170004986/downloads/20170004986.pdf |archive-date=29 December 2021 |access-date=29 December 2021 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center}}</ref>{{rp|p=10}} Two sets of thrusters constitute the observatory's propulsion system.<ref>{{Cite conference |conference=International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics |last1=Petersen |first1=Jeremy |last2=Tichy |first2=Jason |last3=Wawrzyniak |first3=Geoffrey |last4=Richon |first4=Karen |date=2014-04-21 |title=James Webb Space Telescope Initial Mid-Course Correction Monte Carlo Implementation using Task Parallelism |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140008868 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609054522/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140008868 |archive-date=2023-06-09 |id=GSFC-E-DAA-TN14162 |location=Laurel, MD }}</ref> Because the thrusters are located solely on the Sun-facing side of the observatory, all station-keeping operations are designed to slightly undershoot the required amount of thrust in order to avoid pushing Webb beyond the semi-stable {{L2}} point, a situation which would be unrecoverable.

Webb is the formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on [[infrared astronomy]], it is also a successor to the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Webb will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies.<ref name=RHowardJWST>Howard, Rick, [https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/629955main_RHoward_JWST_3_6_12.pdf "James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221150840/https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/629955main_RHoward_JWST_3_6_12.pdf |date=21 December 2021 }}, ''nasa.gov'', 6 March 2012 {{PD-notice}}</ref> Observing in the infrared spectrum is a key technique for achieving this, because of [[cosmological redshift]], and because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas. This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared spectrum, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html|title=Infrared Atmospheric Windows|publisher=Cool Cosmos|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-date=11 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011101051/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The more distant an object is, the younger it appears; its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the [[Expansion of the universe|universe is expanding]], as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and objects at extreme distances are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared.<ref name="ir_astronomy"/> Webb's infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.<ref name="firstlight">{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/firstlight.html|title=Webb Science: The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization|publisher=NASA|access-date=9 June 2011|archive-date=22 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122181907/https://jwst.nasa.gov/firstlight.html|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

== Ground support and operations ==
The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI), in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on the [[Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University]], was selected in 2003 as the Science and Operations Center (S&OC) for Webb with an initial budget of US$162.2 million intended to support operations through the first year after launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/jun/HQ_c03r_Webb.html|title=Webb Spacecraft Science & Operations Center Contract Awarded|author1=Savage, Donald|author2=Neal, Nancy|date=6 June 2003|publisher=NASA|access-date=1 February 2017|archive-date=3 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103132040/https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/jun/HQ_c03r_Webb.html|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> In this capacity, STScI was to be responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to the astronomical community. Data was to be transmitted from Webb to the ground via the [[NASA Deep Space Network]], processed and calibrated at STScI, and then distributed online to astronomers worldwide. Similar to how Hubble is operated, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be allowed to submit proposals for observations. Each year several committees of astronomers will [[peer review]] the submitted proposals to select the projects to observe in the coming year. The authors of the chosen proposals will typically have one year of private access to the new observations, after which the data will become publicly available for download by anyone from the online archive at STScI.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Mirror alignment requires each of the 18 mirror segments, and the secondary mirror, to be positioned to within 50 [[nanometer]]s. NASA compares the required accuracy by analogy: "If the Webb primary mirror were the size of the United States, each [mirror] segment would be the size of Texas, and the team would need to line the height of those Texas-sized segments up with each other to an accuracy of about 1.5 inches".<ref name="Webb blog 2022-02-03">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/02/03/photons-incoming-webb-team-begins-aligning-the-telescope|title=Photons Incoming: Webb Team Begins Aligning the Telescope – James Webb Space Telescope|date=3 February 2022 |access-date=5 February 2022|archive-date=30 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220430083322/https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/02/03/photons-incoming-webb-team-begins-aligning-the-telescope/|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

File:JWST Segment Image Identification.gif|Segment image identification. 18 mirror segments are moved to determine which segment creates which segment image. After matching the mirror segments to their respective images, the mirrors are tilted to bring all the images near a common point for further analysis.
File:JWST Segment Alignment.gif|Segment alignment begins by defocusing the segment images by moving the secondary mirror slightly. Mathematical analysis, called phase retrieval, is applied to the defocused images to determine the precise positioning errors of the segments. Adjustments of the segments then result in 18 well-corrected "telescopes". However, the segments still do not work together as a single mirror.
File:JWST Image Stacking.gif|Image stacking. To put all of the light in a single place, each segment image must be stacked on top of one another. In the image stacking step, the individual segment images are moved so that they fall precisely at the center of the field to produce one unified image. This process prepares the telescope for coarse phasing.

The 18 images of HD 84406 are matched to their respective mirror segments, and the 18 segments are brought into approximate alignment centered on the star ("Segment Image Identification"). Each segment was then individually corrected of its major focusing errors, using a technique called [[phase retrieval]], resulting in 18 separate good quality images from the 18 mirror segments ("Segment Alignment"). The 18 images from each segment, were then moved so they precisely overlap to create a single image ("Image Stacking").<ref name="Webb blog 2022-02-03" />

With the mirrors positioned for almost correct images, they had to be fine tuned to their operational accuracy of 50 nanometers, less than one [[wavelength]] of the light that will be detected. A technique called ''dispersed fringe sensing'' was used to compare images from 20 pairings of mirrors, allowing most of the errors to be corrected ("Coarse Phasing"), and then introduced light defocus to each segment's image, allowing detection and correction of almost all remaining errors ("Fine Phasing"). These two processes were repeated three times, and Fine Phasing will be routinely checked throughout the telescope's operation. After three rounds of Coarse and Fine Phasing, the telescope was well aligned at one place in the NIRCam field of view. Measurements will be made at various points in the captured image, across all instruments, and corrections calculated from the detected variations in intensity, giving a well-aligned outcome across all instruments ("Telescope Alignment Over Instrument Fields of View"). Finally, a last round of Fine Phasing and checks of image quality on all instruments was performed, to ensure that any small residual errors remaining from the previous steps, were corrected ("Iterate Alignment for Final Correction"). The telescope's mirror segments were then aligned and able to capture precise focused images.<ref name="Webb blog 2022-02-03" />

== Allocation of observation time ==
Webb observing time is allocated through a General Observers (GO) program, a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program, and a Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calls for Proposals & Policy|url=https://jwst.stsci.edu/science-planning/calls-for-proposals-and-policy|publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute|access-date=13 November 2017|archive-date=15 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715144546/https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-planning/calls-for-proposals-and-policy|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The GTO program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time and will represent the bulk of the observing time. GO programs are selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope.

These 13 ERS programs were to use a total of 242.8 hours of observing time on the telescope (not including Webb observing overheads and [[Slew (spacecraft)|slew]] time).

In a preprint released around the same time, NASA, ESA and CSA scientists stated that "almost across the board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected". The document described a series of observations during the commissioning, when the instruments captured spectra of transiting exoplanets with a precision better than 1000 ppm per data point, and tracked moving objects with speeds up to 67 milliarcseconds/second, more than twice as fast as the requirement.{{efn|name= tracking }} It also obtained the spectra of hundreds of stars simultaneously in a dense field towards the [[Milky Way]]'s [[Galactic Center]].

In June 2023 detection of organic molecules 12 billion light-years away in a galaxy called [[SPT0418-47]] using the Webb telescope was announced.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Strickland |first=Ashley |date=2023-06-06 |title=Webb telescope detects organic molecules in distant galaxy |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/webb-telescope-distant-organic-molecules-scn/index.html |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

On 12 July 2023, NASA celebrated the first year of operations with the release of Webb's image of a small star-forming region in the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]], 390 light years away.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Grey |first=Charles |date=2023-07-15 |title=James Webb Space Telescope Marks First Year of Science Operations |url=https://airspacenews.net/james-webb-space-telescope-marks-first-year-of-science-operations/ |access-date=2023-07-22 |website=AIR SPACE News |language=en-US}}</ref>

In September 2023, two astrophysicists questioned the accepted [[Standard Model of Cosmology]], based on the latest JWST studies.<ref name="NYT-20230902">{{cite news |last1=Frank |first1=Adam |last2=Gleiser |first2=Marcelo |title=The Story of Our Universe May Be Starting to Unravel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/opinion/cosmology-crisis-webb-telescope.html |date=2 September 2023 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20230902161629/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/opinion/cosmology-crisis-webb-telescope.html |archivedate=2 September 2023 |accessdate=3 September 2023 }}</ref>

In December 2023, NASA released Christmas holiday-related images by JWST, including the [[NGC 2264|Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster]] and others.<ref name="NYT-20231219">{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Katrina |title=It's Christmastime in the Cosmos - Astronomers have a long tradition of finding holiday cheer in outer space. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/science/christmas-stars-galaxies-webb-nasa.html |date=19 December 2023 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20231219114751/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/science/christmas-stars-galaxies-webb-nasa.html |archivedate=19 December 2023 |accessdate=19 December 2023 }}</ref>

In May 2024, the JWST detected the farthest known black hole merger.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Webb detects most distant black hole merger to date |url=https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_detects_most_distant_black_hole_merger_to_date |access-date=2024-05-19 |website=www.esa.int |language=en}}</ref> Occurring within the galaxy system ZS7, 740 million years after the Big Bang, this discovery suggests a fast growth rate for black holes through mergers, even in the young Universe.
