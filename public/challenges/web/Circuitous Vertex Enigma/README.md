# Circuitous Vertex Enigma
Baba just finished making some shitty competitive programming questions for this competition called ISC2CTF or something. After creating these challenges, he had some traumatic flashbacks of when he only got Silver for the national olympaid of informatics or something.
Wanting to improve his graph theory skills so he can compete next year when he retains, he's asking for YOUR help to help teach him what graph theory is about!

PS. Competitive Programming questions can be found in misc :D
